 'backend/data.js' is a reserved Velo file that enables you to create data hooks.

 A data hook is an event handler (function) that runs code before or after interactions with your site's database collections. 
 For example, you may want to intercept an item before it is added to your collection to tweak the data or to perform a final validation.

 Syntax for functions:

  export function [collection name]_[action](item, context){}

 Example: 

  export function myCollection_beforeInsert(item, context){}
